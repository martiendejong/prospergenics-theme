# Agent Progress

## 2026-08-26 — task 733
Done: front page `<title>` rewritten from generic "Home - Prospergenics" to
"Prospergenics | AI & Software Development Coaching Community" via a
`document_title_parts` filter in functions.php. PR #1.
Verified: `php -l` clean; standalone PHP harness (mocks is_front_page/is_paged/
apply_filters, no live WP in this repo) — 3/3 assertions pass.
Left: deploy to the live theme on prospergenics.com is the usual manual step
for this repo (no build agent/CI here); not done by this session.
